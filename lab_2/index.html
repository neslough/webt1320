    <h1>Favorite Card</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a pretty big fan of the trading card game Magic: the Gathering.
      Among the over 20,000 cards that exist within it, I have a particular favorite card.
      A basic understanding of the mechanics is required ot understand my favorite card, however.
      Players start with a life total, an arbitrary number representing that player's health.
      The most basic goal of the game is to attack with creatures, dealing damage to your opponent, until that player's life total reaches 0 or less.

    <h2>Elspeth, Sun's Champion</h2>
    <h3>Legendary Planeswalker - Elspeth</h3>
    <p>
      Elspeth herself is a planeswalker, a card type representing an ally in your battle.
      She has three abilities, which can aid you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating three soldier creature tokens.
        Given that your goal is to attack your opponent,
        gaining an additional three creatures every turn is incredibly useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mass removing relatively large creatures.
        The creature tokens Elspeth brings with her have fairly small base stats,
        so they tend not to fair well against creatures with greater stats.
        For this reason, Elspeth also comes with the ability to destroy all creatures that are larger than an specific threshold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, her last 'ultimate' ability allows her tokens to gain a huge advantage,
        which can immediately swing the game in your favor, if not win the game outright.
      </li>
    </ul>
