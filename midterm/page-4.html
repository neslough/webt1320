        <h3>Additional Sections</h3>
        <p>
          As previously mentioned, there are plenty of cards that are just generically good, and aren't deck-specific.
          Due to the color restrictions on EDH, there is a divide between cards that can go into decks with certain color identities, and colorless cards that can go in any deck.
        </p>

            <h4>Crossover Commanders</h4>
            <h5>32 cards, specific colors</h5>
            <p>
              In EDH, your commander dictates what colors can be in your deck.
              Therefore, the more colors your commander has, the more cards you have the ability to play.
              For that reason, this section has three-color commanders, which seem to have the right balance of colors.
              As the strategies in this cube are mostly two-color, three-color commanders usually involve mixing together multiple strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Muldrotha, the Gravetide<br/>
              This card allows you to play green, blue, and black, while being incredibly powerful in her own right.

            <h5>10 cards, specific colors</h5>
            <p>
              As you need to have a commander to play the game, adding few more helps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Tatyova, Benthic Druid<br/>
              As playing lands is something virtually every deck does, getting more value, like drawing extra cards and gaining life from doing so is nice.

            <h4>Fixing Lands</h4>
            <h5>79 cards, specific colors</h5>
            <p>
              The vast majority of EDH decks use more than one color of mana.
              Each deck can play any number of basic lands, each of which can provide you mana of a specific color.
              You can't use only red mana to cast a blue spell, even if you're playing a red and blue deck.
              Therefore, access to lands which can provide you with mana of more than one color can be useful, as that increases your likelihood of having access to the correct colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Command Tower<br/>
              This card provides you with every color of mana you need, with virtually no downside.
              If you play a deck with more than one color, it's always a card you want.

            <h4>Arifact Ramp</h4>
            <h5>50 cards, mostly colorless</h5>
            <p>
              You only play one land per turn, but it is possible to get additional mana from other sources.
              This is an important part of EDH, called mana ramping.
              This is most often done with the help of artifact cards, which is why this section exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Arcane Signet<br/>
              It's an artifact version of Command Tower.
              Ramp this useful typically costs 3 mana, so to get it at 2 mana is especially nice.

            <h4>Mono-colored Value</h4>
            <h5>100 cards, mostly specific colors</h5>
            <p>
              More cards were necessary to allow for more card choice while drafting, so more were added.
              All of the cards in this section require a specific color or are colorless, which allows them to be played in a number of decks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Harmonize<br/>
              Drawing cards is the single most important thing you can do in a game of commander, and this card is great at drawing cards.

            <h4>Dual Colored Value</h4>
            <h5>40 cards, specific colors</h5>
            <p>
              This section is similar to the previous, except all of the cards in this section are exactly two colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Despark<br/>
              For two mana, Despark can get rid of almost any problematic card an opponent has played, permanently.
              Any deck that can play it should.

            <h4>Generic Value</h4>
            <h5>43 cards, colorless</h5>
            <p>
              These are random cards that are just good in general, and can be played in any deck because they are colorless.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sample card: Ancient Tomb<br/>
              Almost all lands produce exactly one mana.
              Though it has the downside of causing you damage, Ancient Tomb generates two mana, which at times can be twice as good as any other land.
