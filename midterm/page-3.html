        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          When designing a cube, it's necessary to decide a number of strategies for which to build sections around.
          I reccomend using at least ten for an EDH cube, as with the example strategies below.
        </p>
        <article>
          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>White + Blue Control</h4>
            <p>
              The main purpose of a control strategy is to heavily interact with your opponents, and prevent them from executing their game plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Mana Drain<br/>
              Countering an opponent's spell essentially undoes whatever card they just played.
              The upside of receiving mana in return, and the efficiency of this card make it an excellent inclusion.
            </p>

          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>Blue + Black Theft and Clones</h4>
            <p>
              The main purpose of a theft strategy is to take your opponent's cards, and play them yourself.
              A clones strategy copies your opponent's cards rather than outright stealing them.
              These two strategies can be combined, allowing you to beat your opponents using their own cards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Bribery<br/>
              This card allows you to pick an opponent's best creature card from their deck, and immediately play it.
              Unlike most other theft effects, you get to take their card before they even play it, and you get to choose from any of the cards in their deck.
            </p>

          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>Black + Red Aggro</h4>
            <p>
              As the main goal of any game of Magic is to deal damage to your opponents until they lose all of their health, a strategy built around dealing damage as quickly as possible might be viable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Drakuseth, Maw of Flames<br/>
              This massive dragon can dole out obscene amounts of damage in a hurry, and the fact that he's a legendary creature means he can be your commander.
            </p>

          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>Red + Green Lands</h4>
            <p>
              Land cards produce mana, the main resource that is used in the game.
              By building a deck meant to interact with your own lands, you can accrue advantage to defeat your opponents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Gruul Turf<br/>
              Most of the effects that synergize with lands care about you playing lands.
              Gruul Turf is a special land that when you play it, requires you put a land from play back into your hand.
              By choosing to put Gruul Turf itself back, you can have a way to repeatedly play a land card, while utilizing any cards that care about you playing lands.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h4>Green + White Tokens</h4>
            <p>
              The most common way to deal damage to your opponents is to attack them with creatures.
              Tokens (usually) are small, expendable creatures you can create an army of quite quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Elspeth, Sun's Champion<br/>
              Elspeth is a planeswalker, which in the story represents an ally that joins forces with you.
              This particular planeswalker brings a literal army with her, represented by a number of tokens she can amass every turn.
            </p>

            <h4>White + Black Lifegain</h4>
            <p>
              Because most strategies revolve around trying to lower your life total by damaging you, gaining life to raise it can be useful.
              Combined with cards that can benefit from this lifegain, an effective strategy can be created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Archangel of Thune<br/>
              In addition to having lifelink, an effective way to gain life, this angel also provides you with additional utility every time you gain life, making your creatures into more imposing threats.
            </p>

            <h4>Blue + Red Artifacts</h4>
            <p>
              Until this point I hadn't actually mentioned the card type artifacts.
              Artifacts typically represent nonliving objects that contain some sort of power, and a formidable strategy can be built from leveraging their ability to interact with one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Krark-Clan Ironworks<br/>
              Mana is the most import resource in the game, and Krark-Clan Ironworks allows you to gain large amounts of mana for little cost, when utilized correctly.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/c/6/c60174d6-1f9d-4870-b3db-34d6fcb3f6ab.jpg" alt="Krark-Clan Ironworks"/>

            <h4>Black + Green Reanimator</h4>
            <p>
              The graveyard is a place creatures are put when they die, but a reanimator strategy is built around bringing them back from the dead.
              There are plenty of ways to get creatures into a graveyard without actually killing them, and the cost to reanimate a powerful creature is typically way less than the cost to actually play that creature, so powerful cards can be played at a discount.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Reanimate<br/>
              The card for which this entire strategy is named, and still one of the most efficient ways to return a creature card from the graveyard.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>Red + White Voltron</h4>
            <p>
              While in commander, players start at 40 life, if any player is ever dealt 21 damage by a particular commander, they lose the game, regardless of their actually life total.
              For this reason, giving your commander a bunch of swords etc. to have it deal more damage is a viable strategy.
              This strategy has been given the name 'Voltron' after the '80s cartoon, because it basically combines a number of smaller parts into a single, larger, more powerful entity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: All That Glitters<br/>
              The main types of cards that go into beefing up your commander are Equipments, a special type of artifact, and Auras, a special type of enchantment.
              Due to the fact that you'll likely have a lot of these cards, All That Glitters can greatly increase your commander's ability to deal damage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/9/d9713032-2956-4564-b5f5-2dd16245a4e6.jpg" alt="All That Glitters"/>

          <div class="strategy-text">
            <h4>Green + Blue Pod</h4>
            <p>
              This is by far the most difficult strategy to explain.
              Basically, each card has what's called a converted mana cost, which is basically how much mana you have to spend to play that card.
              Cards like Birthing Pod can use that converted mana cost to get you specific creature cards from your deck.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key card: Birthing Pod<br/>
              Birthing Pod allows you to essentially cash in a creature card to get a new creature that costs 1 more mana.
              This may seem like a small effect, but the ability to grab exactly whichever creature you need at any given moment is incredibly powerful.
            </p>
          </div>
