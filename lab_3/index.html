        <h2>A few album arts</h2>
        <p>Happiness isn't their most liked album, but it has as few hits I enjoy</p>

        <p>Their self titled album is by far my favorite, especially with its art</p>
        <img src="self-titled.jpg" alt="self-titled" width="400" height="400" />
        <p>Though they have numerous other albums, I couldn't find any reasonable quality images of the art</p>
